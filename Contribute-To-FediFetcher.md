## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, I assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/nanos/FediFetcher/wiki).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/nanos/FediFetcher/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, I recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/nanos/FediFetcher/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

I will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

If you prefer, you can also ask me questions directly on Mastodon [@michael@thms.uk](https://mstdn.thms.uk/@michael).

> ### Legal Notice <!-- omit in toc -->
> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.

### Reporting Bugs

I use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/nanos/FediFetcher/issues/new).
- Explain the behaviour you would expect and the actual behaviour.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. 
- Include any relevant longs, and if you are running FediFetcher as GitHub Action, please link to the GitHub Action execution.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for FediFetcher, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nanos/FediFetcher/issues). I suggest you do the following when making a suggestion:

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most FediFetcher users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Contributing to the code

If you wish to contribute to the code of FediFetcher, you are very welcome to. Ideally, have a look at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nanos/FediFetcher/issues) to see if there are any outstanding issues that you wish to help implement or fix. If you do decide to take on an open issue, please leave a quick comment, so that I know you are working on this, and don't duplicate effort unnecessarily.

You are also free to contribute things that are not on the Issue Tracker. 

Either way, to contribute, please note that I use GitHub Pull Requests to manage contributions. When you believe your code is ready, simply file a Pull Request. 

Please provide a good description of any changes you have made, and importantly the reasoning behind them. If your contribution refers to an existing issue, please reference this issue in your Pull Request description.

I will then endeavour to review your request promptly, with the aim of merging as soon as I can, but please be patient: Essentially FediFetcher is a one-man-project, and I do take holidays from time time.

### Improving The Documentation

I welcome contributions to the documentation. The content of the documentation can be found in this GitHub repository https://github.com/nanos/FediFetcher-docs, and you are welcome to file Pull Requests to this.

As with contributions to the code itself, please provide a good description of any changes you have made, and importantly the reasoning behind them. If your contribution refers to an existing issue, please reference this issue in your Pull Request description.

I will then endeavour to review your request promptly, with the aim of merging as soon as I can, but please be patient: Essentially FediFetcher is a one-man-project, and I do take holidays from time time.

To discuss the documentation, please use the main [FediFetcher GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nanos/FediFetcher/issues).
